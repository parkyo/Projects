Problem

  Given N integers, count the number of pairs of those integers that have a difference equal to another integer K.

Input Format

  The first line of input will contain 2 space delimited integers giving the values of N and K with the following constraints:

  0 <= N <= 50000
  0 <= K <= 5000
  The second line of input will contain N space delimited integers. The value of each integer will be in the range [0...2500].

Output Format

  The output will be a single integer indicating the number of pairs of integers with difference K.
